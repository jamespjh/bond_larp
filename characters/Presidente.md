El Presidente
==========================================

Played by: Jim

Starting location: Tropico, island paradise

Summary
-------
You are El Presidente of the island paradise of Tropico, known for the beauty of its inhabitants, its fine rums and cigars, occasional hurricanes and volcanic eruptions. Your country is as yet unaligned between the Eastern and Western Blocs, who are beginning to look upon it with hungry eyes. Whatever happens, you are determined to preserve the fun loving and laid back island attitude.

Character
---------

Shit, shit shit, you're the President! This wasn't supposed to happen! Bad things always happen to El Presidente and you're almost certain to get assassinated or something. Just look what happened to your predecessor!

Tropico's first democratic elections happened a couple of months ago, and you never expected to actually be elected, you were the joke candidate after all! But somehow people didn't seem to get the joke, and you won on a landslide. You left your life as a doctor in the local hospital and moved into the presidential palace, where over the last few weeks you've had to get your head around five year banana forecasts, currency fluctuations and the exact protocols for international diplomacy. You're glad you got to be on the radio on Juan Cuervos's station CU741 FM, right after the programme where they replace the words of calpyso songs with numbers.
What fun... Shame it stopped broadcasting after the eruption last week.

Worst of all, you quickly became aware that the two global superpowers - the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc - had both decided that Tropico's non-aligned status cannot continue. You've been receiving increasingly urgent missives from both East and West, pressing you to join their side, and they've even started making some quite threatening insinuations about the consequences of doing otherwise. You've also received reports from your Department of Internal Affairs that secret agents from both sides may even be present on the Island, stirring up the population and preparing for someone to replace you if things don't go their way.

You're seriously stressed about all this, and in order to relax, as well as to fulfil one of your manifesto commitments (who says politicians don't keep their promises?) you are bringing one of the world's premier sporting events to Tropico this year. Tropico's economy has traditionally consisted of peasant farming, rum and voodoo knick-knacks. But the island's pristine beaches and unspoiled coastline make it ripe for development as the next tourist hotspot.  As a first step in your 5 year tourist development plan, you have secured for Tropico the hosting of this year's **World Beach Table Football Championship Finals!** As a prize, you intend
to use The Coconut Cup, an old gold antique which has been in your family for a while.

You hope that the finals will attract competitors and spectators from around the world to participate in the exciting spectacle of swimwear-clad contestants frantically spinning their poles. How you organise and advertise the competition is up to you, but the world's media will be tuning in to watch the final at **9.30pm** so don't disappoint them. A Tropican extravaganza would really put your country on the map, and just think of what you could do with all those Western dollars or Eastern roubles! It would enable you perhaps to povide decent healthcare for your population, or alternatively to swell the coffers of your hidden Swiss bank account. Or perhaps you'll just spend it on a few extra bodyguards so you don't get assassinated...

You've got a few other thoughts about how Tropico could use its natural resources. The island produces world-class rum and cigars. At the heart of Tropico Island is the volcano known as the Eye of the Phoenix. Though a constant threat to the lives of all islanders, its fertile soils are the source of the island's bountiful crops, and its volcanic muds and salts are a renowned product the world over, as foreigners try to capture a small part of the islanders' legendary beauty, said to result from bathing in the hot pools near the volcano itself. You know that local businessperson **El Jefe (Salley)** has plans for the commercial development of all these resources. In fact, she seemed to have set up some kind of monopoly deal for the island's exports with your predecessor. Not everyone is happy about this, and when you were at the Island's best bar the other day (well actually its only bar...) you heard the bartender **Quarrel (Katherine)** talking to someone about some kind of meetings, and you're sure they mentioned redistribution of wealth. 

Being a ruler is so difficult, particularly with this new democracy thingy they've invented. Perhaps you need to pick up some tips from people more experienced than yourself. Your Foreign Affairs Department has informed you of a big diplomatic conference that's happening soon. This year's World Economic Forum (WEF) has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremly risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now broke, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could therefore endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West. Given the importance of the occasion, you're sure all the bigwigs will be there, and it could be useful to attend. You've written to the conference organiser, bigshot businesswoman **Cherie LaFigure (Khadija)** asking for an invitation, but so far you've had no reply...
