Eve Moneypenny
==========================================

Played by: Sacha

Cover: Eva Lanche, chalet girl

Starts in: Skisky, glitzy Eastern Bloc winter sports resort

Summary
-------
You are Eva Lanche, doing a season as a chalet girl at the winter sports resort of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc, and perfecting your downhill technique at the same time. 

But you are not really Eva Lanche, you are really Miss Eve Moneypenny, member of MI6 and Private Secretary to M, head of the service. Only you are getting a bit bored with being a secretary, and never seeing any of the action, so you have snuck across the Iron Curtain to find out what's really happening in the Eastern Bloc and prove that you're just as good as any field agent. You have infiltrated an important scientific symposium happening at Skisky, the First International Superhuman Soviet. Perhaps you can find out some information that will help you advance your career, or if not, as an accomplished athlete you can at least turn a few heads on the ski slopes.

Character
---------
You are Miss Eve Moneypenny, member of MI6 and Private Secretary to **M (Jan)**, head of the Service. You have been working for M for some years, but you are getting tired of typing letters, taking dictation and generally spending long hours in the London office sorting her life out. This wasn't how you imagined a career as a secret agent to be. 

You were originally recruited into the Service by an agent called **James Bond (James G)** when you were doing a season as a ski hostess in the Alps, just after finishing finishing school. He was on a mission that went very wrong, and you sorted it out for him. He clearly fancies you and you practically saved his life by warning him about that booby-trapped bobsled, but instead of thanks all you have received is a constant barrage of sexual harrassment. You've tried complaining to M but she just laughs it off. They
even gave you the demeaning code name "Hatstand".

Bond is definitely not your type. You did have a promising relationship with a friendly CIA agent, **Felix Leiter (Steve)**, when he was on temporary assignment to London. Felix had promised to give you some tips on how to become a field agent and you had spent some wonderful weekends parachuting over the home counties, yomping up mountains in Scotland and surfing in Cornwall. You haven't heard from him since he left London however and you don't know why - you had thought it was all going so well.

You were a talented athlete in your youth and you gave up a promising skiing career to join the Service and you are now on the brink of throwing it all in, unless you can see more of the action. You know that the combination of your formidable physical and organisational skills would make you a fantastic field agent, much better than either Bond or Leiter. You've decided to take matters into your own hands by proving it.

As a Secretary, you have great skills with documentation and you've even been known to **forge** the odd expenses claim when Bond hasn't kept all his receipts. Unknown to MI6, you have forged yourself an Eastern Bloc visa. You told M you were going for a much-needed holiday, packed your bags and left, crossing the Iron Curtain to Skisky, a resort town high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc. Tonight, scientists are coming together for an important and secretive scientific symposium, the First International Superhuman Soviet. Delegates to the symposium will have the opportunity to privately discuss their discoveries or superior capabilites with a senior member of the Politburo. It is rumoured that those who convince him they have a valuable discovery or unique talent may earn the title, Hero of the Soviet Union. They will have the opportunity to enjoy the world-class skiing and relaxation facilities at the resort and enjoy the local mountain culture, with its curious folklore of mysterious, mischevious mountain giants.

This conference offers the perfect opportunity to find out some super-secret information. If you can do this, it will prove that you should be reassigned to field work, and could reinvigorate your flagging career. If not, you may at least be able to make some useful contacts who could add some spice to your life. 

You have also heard that the World Beach Table Football Championship Finals are being held in Tropico this year. If nothing turns up at this conference, a trip to this paradise island might be a good opportunity to demonstrate your sporting prowess to the world, and you are interested in finding out more about how to enter.

Unfortunately though, you are already running a bit late as you were supposed to report back to base yesterday. You were assigned to be part of the MI6 team guarding the World Economic Forum, which is happening in Monte Carlo this evening, along with **M**, **Bond** and MI6's technical whizz, **Q (Alistair)**. 

This year's World Economic Forum has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremly risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now broke, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could therefore endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West. It is therefore very likely that Eastern operatives will try to disrupt the conference.

You should probably report in soon, with a good excuse for your late arrival. On the other hand, you assume that given your lowly status, your colleagues will barely notice your absence...
