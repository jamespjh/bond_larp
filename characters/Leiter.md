Summary
-------

You are Max Zipp, French F1 driver and tax exile living in Monaco.

But you are not really Max Zipp, you have only borrowed this identity as a cover. You are Felix Leiter, head of the CIA and recently promoted to being the chief spymaster of the intelligence services of the whole Western Bloc, after the unfortunate demise of MI6 boss **M** at the hands of supervillain **El Chupacabra**. Tonight you are under cover in Monte Carlo, where the World Economic Forum is taking place, and you need to look after the West's interests.

Character
---------
You are Felix Leiter, proud free marketeer and intrepid CIA operative, recently promoted to being the chief spymaster of the intelligence services of the whole Western Bloc, code name M. 

It's not easy being M, particularly when the West is flat broke. Years of austerity have not worn well and the population of the Western Bloc is starting to get restive. Unless you gain access to an influx of cash, or something else that could pacify them, you are seriously worried that you could have a revolution on your hands. 

More immediately, you have two big issues on your agenda. The first is the outcome of this year's World Economic Forum, which could have vital consequences for the cash-strapped West. The conference has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremely risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now penniless, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West.  

The organiser of the conference is a wealthy and respected industrialist with business interests in both East and West called **Cherie LaFigure (Khadija)**. She was the one figure both sides could agree upon to preside over the conference and to invite official delegates from around the world. Conveniently, she also owns the largest and most stylish casino in Monaco, which will be the venue for the conference. Informal negotiations are continuing through the night, but a final vote of authorised delegates, who must present the official voting card supplied by Ms LaFigure, will be taken in full session at 10.45pm. Each delegate will have one vote, but will also be able to give a brief speech, which may include other means of persuasion... 

Your mission in Monte Carlo is twofold: make sure that the West gets a good deal at the World Economic Forum; and prevent any disruption of the negotiations by Eastern Bloc operatives. You have one invitation for someone to attend the World Economic Forum to represent the West, but you haven't decided yet whether to go yourself or send someone else.

The other issue on your agenda is the status of the small island paradise of Tropico, which is as yet unaligned between East and West. Although Tropico is clearly in the Western sphere of influence, lying just off the coast of Florida, the Soviets have nevertheless been courting the local President assiduously.

In a previous field assignment as CIA-MI6 liaison officer, you worked with the Brits on a mission to persuade Tropico to join the Western Bloc. As part of your assignment you were able to secure a rock solid CIA contact on Tropico in the form of the local industrialist and totally legitimate businessperson, known locally on the island as **'El Jefe' (Salley)**. El Jefe controls all the main exports from Tropico, which consist mainly of cigars, rum and beautiful women, so this relationship also has some side benefits in the kickbacks it affords in return for Uncle Sam's dollar. You also heard about **El Presidente's (Jim's)** plans to kick start tourism on the island by hosting the World Beach Table Football Championship Finals this year. If you didn't have other things on your mind, you'd be keen to go and watch the scantily clad participants battle it out for victory, and maybe even have a go yourself.

Nevertheless, you're also aware there are some seditious tendencies on Tropico, and even some who think that they can still go it alone. Ridiculous for such a small island.

While on temporary assignment in London, you also made the acquaintance of a pretty young secretary named **Eve Moneypenny (Sacha)**. You tried the patented Leiter moves on her and she fell right into your lap. It wasn't the holiday romance you expected though, because it turns out that Miss Moneypenny is quite the adrenaline junkie. You thought your survivalist upbringing in the wilds of Nebraska had made you fairly hardy, but you just couldn't keep up. Parachuting one week, trips up freezing cold hills in Scotland in the pouring rain the next, until you were quite exhausted! And then she kept pestering you for tips on how to become a field agent. In the end you had to request a transfer to Manila in order to escape. If you remember correctly, she was the previous M's private secretary, which must mean that she now works for you...

Manila was where things went seriously weird. You and your native guide were on a mission to investigate an unidentified radio signals, a voice reading endless strings of numbers 
on 741 kHz, coming from the middle of the rainforest. You found nothing but some ancient ruins and old tribal artefacts (a few of which you pocketed, as they looked like they could be valuable), but your guide started babbling the same numbers and talking about tuning into ancient frequencies. Suspecting malaria, you dosed him with quinine and made it safely back to the nearest village. But in the night, you woke just in time to find the whole village had formed some kind of frenzied lynch mob, muttering ommm... 741... ommm... and intent on tearing you limb from limb. You fled with only your pyjamas, and managed to lose them in the jungle. You deployed your survival skills to subsist on snakes and insects for 14 days while you trekked back to the CIA safe house. At least you think that happened.
You barely made it out alive, but reported the whole thing back to the President, who seemed to think you had done an amazing job and decorated you for valour. You were promoted to Head of the CIA, Director of Central Intelligence. 

As the Head of Western Intelligence, you are supposed to be supported in your missions by your team of MI6 agents: secret agent **James Bond 007 (James G)**; technical whizz kid **Q (Alistair)**; and the super efficient Secretary **Miss Eve Moneypenny (Sacha)**. At present, though, only Q is here in Monte Carlo, having travelled with the previous M from London. You think that Bond and Moneypenny may not yet have been informed of your promotion to M. Q didn't take the news with great enthusiasm either. He's been very quiet recently, and keeps muttering what sounds like some kind of lottery numbers. You really need to reinvigorate the team through your new management style and make a break with the fusty old MI6 regime.

Tonight, you will be posing as Max Zipp, F1 driver resident in Monaco for tax purposes. Your fluent French, learnt on a summer school in Quebec in 1995, will help you blend in perfectly.
