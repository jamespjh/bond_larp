You are Quentin Boothroyd, a professional gambler who has come to try out your latest infallible system at the best casino in Monte Carlo.

Except you are not really a professional gambler, this is simply your cover story. In fact you are Q, technological whizz of MI6, and you have been sent to Monte Carlo on a mission. The World Economic Forum is taking place at the casino this evening, and you have been tasked with helping to protect the West's interests against the threat of the Eastern Bloc.

You are, without doubt, the cleverest person in the Service. It's a real shame that your talents are so little recognised. Old duffers with the right school tie lead  (**M - Jan**), bullies with charisma and a 
good shooting eye get the
rewards and fame (**James Bond- James G**), and even the secretaries (**Miss Moneypenny - Sacha**) get more attention than you boffins.
Yet without you the whole thing would come crashing down. You joined up for Queen and Country, and you still have a sense of duty, but even that's wearing thin after years of being ignored. You'd think, with all the excellent suggestions for a better organised service you keep sending you'd be well recognised (these days you limit yourself to a memo a week) but alas no! 

You're pretty convinced that there's a conspiracy at the top, passing over grammar school boys for the good jobs. Honestly, if you'd been willing to sell your brains to the highest bidder, you'd have been rolling in it by now. Shame you're an honest man. 

Still, you do love to make things, and the Service has given you plenty of opportunities for that. With your recent doldrums, 
you've not managed to invent anything really cool for quite a while. You're vaguely aware that it's been a while since you
took a holiday. Perhaps you'll find inspiration from a change of scene. You're pretty excited to be travelling on field work. 
You'd like to travel further if you can.

Your heart has gone out of the work, so when you heard you were coming to Monte Carlo, you thought you'd put a bit of effort 
into solving this whole "gambling" thing you heard so much about. You're pretty sure you've got an infallible system, and are
keen to try it out. 

That crazy woman, M, made you sail down here on that old pile of matchsticks she claims is a yacht. Thank god you had a chance to modify it a bit, because you ran into the remnants of Hurricane Margaret, and if you hadn't done your bit, it would have been curtains. That was a jolly interesting underwater city you found though. You're not sure M quite understood the archeological significance of those old runes, and the ancient carvings of dinosaurs looked to predate modern paleontology by quite some centuries. And with people alongside them, even riding them! That'll quite upset them back at the museum. If you can just find someone with some diving kit, you're pretty sure you can find your way back, because remarkably, you think there was a radio signal broadcasting from the ruins, repeating numbers, most, you notice,
being various powers or multiples of 741. Funny though, it's probably just the bends, but ever since you got back, you could swear you can hear a quiet voice whispering to you sometimes in the night. Thank goodness for your tinfoil nightcap.

Objectives
----------

* Be recognised, at least inside the Service, for your true worth.
* Deploy your perfect gambling system and win, proving your genius once again.
* Find out what is going on with the strange ruins.
* Travel the world and seek inspiration for new cool stuff to make.

If you do manage to recover your inspiration, you've been supplied with a patent form which you can use to
register an invention that could be of great power.

Be aware that the best inventions are likely to be created through **collaboration and teamwork**
*and most importantly the application of* **special secret ingredients**.
If you think you may have a potential secret ingredient, you should check with the GM.

When you think your invention is special enough, bring the form to the GM with your collaborators
and secret ingredients.
