General Anatol Alexis Gogol
==========================================

Played by: Bob

Starting location: Skisky, glitzy Eastern Bloc winter sports resort

Summary
-------
You are General Anatol Alexis Gogol, head of the Eastern Bloc's state security apparatus and member of the Politburo. Tonight, you are presiding over an important scientific symposium, the First International Superhuman Soviet. The purpose of the conference is to share progress towards the development of the ideal comrade, a hero of progress and human development. The event is taking place in the winter sports paradise of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc, with facilities far superior to those of the decadent West.

Character
---------

You are General Anatol Alexis Gogol, generally known as Gogol, member of the Politburo and Head of the Eastern Bloc secret intelligence forces. 

It's not easy being Gogol, particularly when the East is flat broke. Years of centralised planning have not worn well and the population of the Eastern Bloc is starting to get restive. Unless you gain access to an influx of cash, or something else that could pacify them, you are seriously worried that you could have a counter-revolution on your hands.

In particular, you have two major political issues on your agenda. 

The first is the outcome of this year's World Economic Forum, which could have vital consequences for the cash-strapped East. The conference has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremely risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now penniless, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West.

The conference organiser is a wealthy and respected industrialist with business interests in both East and West called **Cherie LaFigure (Khadija)**. She was the one figure both sides could agree upon to preside over the conference and to invite official delegates from around the world. Conveniently, she also owns the largest and most stylish casino in Monaco, which will be the venue for the conference. Informal negotiations are continuing through the night, but a final vote of authorised delegates, who must present the official voting card supplied by Ms LaFigure, will be taken in full session at 10.45pm. Each delegate will have one vote, but will also be able to give a brief speech, which may include other means of persuasion... You have one invitation for someone to attend the World Economic Forum to represent the East, but you haven't decided yet whether to go yourself or send someone else.

The other issue on your agenda is the status of the small island paradise of Tropico, which is as yet unaligned between East and West. You are trying to persuade Tropico to join your side, but you suspect there has been some covert activity aimed at frustrating your efforts by the CIA, who are desperate to avoid an Eastern Bloc enclave being created just off the coast of Florida. Your local contact on the island is a native bartender called **Quarrel (Katherine)** who is supposed to be putting together a guerilla army to seize power when the time is right, though you hear she's more interested in drinking and lounging on the beach.

You are supported in your missions by your top KGB agent **Ninelle (Michelle)**. Ninelle was on a mission to find out more about what was happening on Tropico, but when you heard about the World Economic Forum, you sent an urgent message ordering her to go to Monte Carlo and infiltrate the conference. You haven't yet had a report back from Ninelle on either mission, but you trust her implicitly and you know she's the best agent in the business, so you're sure you'll hear something good soon. It would be useful, however, if you could find someone with a Western visa to go to Monaco, find out how she got on, and report back to you (though you realise she's likely to be under cover).

Tonight, however, you are seeking a little distraction from your troubles by attending an important scientific symposium, the First International Superhuman Soviet, which is taking place in the winter sports paradise of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc. The purpose of the conference is to share progress towards the development of the ideal comrade, a hero of progress and human development, the culmination of the journey that began with Stakhanov. Delegates to the symposium will have the opportunity to impress you with their discoveries or superior capabilites. If they have a truly valuable discovery or unique talent, you may reward them with the title, Hero of the Soviet Union. Though happening in the Eastern Bloc, technologists and industrialists from the decadent West may try to attend as well, hoping to catch up to your glorious scientific leadership, and are seeking entry visas for Skisky through both legal and nefarious means, and you should of course attempt to prevent this from happening.

You will also have the opportunity to enjoy the world-class skiing and relaxation facilities at the resort, far superior to those of the decadent West. Your host is the proprietor of the Skisky resort, **Misha Stroganov (Chris)**. Along with his Head of Security **Major Ursus (Alex)**, who's a local, you are confident that the conference is in good hands at this venue. You have stayed at Skisky many times before, and you are looking forward to catching up with your old friend Mischa, hearing about the latest additions to his collection of unusual animals, and taking time to enjoy the local mountain culture, with its curious fauna and flora, and the folklore of the mysterious Menki, mischevious giants of the mountains.
