Paws - Major Piotr Ursus
==========================================

Played by: Alex

Starting location: Skisky, winter sports resort, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc.

Summary
-------
You are Major Ursus, former Soviet commando, now working in private security. You come from and work at the glitzy winter sports resort of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc, as a security guard for the proprietor, Mr Mischa Stroganov. You are well suited to security work due to the formidable strength of your huge, bear-like hands.

In fact, your boss's real name is not Mischa Stroganov, he is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and you are lead henchperson and fixer for the secret criminal organisation SPECTRE. The organisation's lesser ranks live in fear of your reputation as PAWS. 

Character

You are Major Ursus, former Soviet commando, now working in private security. You come from and work at the glitzy winter sports resort of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc, as a security guard for the proprietor, **Mr Mischa Stroganov (Chris)**. You are well suited to security work due to the formidable strength of your huge, bear-like hands.

In fact, your boss's real name is not Mischa Stroganov, he is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and you are lead henchperson and fixer for the secret criminal organisation SPECTRE. The organisation's lesser ranks live in fear of your reputation as PAWS. You're a gentle soul, most of the time, looking after the people of your village and spreading the wealth
that comes from Mr Blofeld's businesses. Provided, that is, you find a way to exercise your rages. You keep calm, mostly, so long as you get in a bit of mindless violence from time to time, hopefully in a controlled way.

Being a henchperson has its benefits, therefore, -- a steady income, a good supply of Gluhwein, and the occasional piece of thuggery to take the edge off. Blofeld prefers not to travel, so you get to see the world quite a lot under
his orders, growing SPECTRE's power, which is alright by you, since it brings money to the village, and
keeps you in fulfilling work. Lately, though, Blofeld's been acting even odder than usual -- since he came back from
a recent trip to Tropico he keeps muttering about 'voices'. You do hope he's alright. He's not your first supervillain boss, and you hope he doesn't go out like the last one did. Damn **Bond (James G)**.

You were pleased when the boss decided to base his lair in your home village. He dropped you off in his helicopter once to visit your Gran, took a look around, and has hardly left since. Blofeld's been good for Skisky,
bringing money and wealth into the village, which you help disperse. Tonight, you're the host of another
high-profile conference, the First International Superhuman Soviet. The purpose of the conference is to share progress towards the development of the ideal comrade, a hero of progress and human development. Delegates to the symposium will have the opportunity to privately discuss their discoveries or superior capabilites with a senior member of the Politburo. It is rumoured that those who convince him they have a valuable discovery or unique talent may earn the title, Hero of the Soviet Union. Perhaps, with your powerful strength, and enormous hands, this could be a big break for you.

Some of the villagers are unhappy about progress, though, because it draws attention to the village, which the old folk believe is the gateway to the home of the last surviving few Menki, cuddly but formidable snow-men of the mountains. You've never met one, but your grandmother said she was good friends with one, which might explain your huge strength and giant hands. Some villagers are worried that the 
Menki would be exploited if the world ever finds out about them. Gran said they've been dying out ever since
their God-King Bigfoot died when the glacier came. There was more to the old stories too,
something about the cold coming when the Phoenix gave up, and an evil Kraken. She's passed now, sadly, 
but you always wanted to know more. Perhaps you can find the Menki and ask, if they are real.

Objectives
----------

* Support Blofeld in building SPECTRE - he may want you to travel to Tropico or Monaco.
* Find out more about the legendary Menki.
