Summary
-------
You are Max(ine) Zipp, F1  driver and tax exile living in Monaco.

But you are not really Max Zipp, you have only borrowed this identity as a cover. You are M, head of MI6 and defender of Her Majesty's realms and dominions, as well as being the chief spymaster of the intelligence services of the whole Western Bloc. Tonight you are under cover in Monte Carlo, where the World Economic Forum is taking place, and you need to look after the West's interests. 

Character
---------
You are Admiral Dame Millie Messervey, code name 'M', Head of MI6 and currently acting Head of the entire Western Bloc secret intelligence forces. Tonight, you are in charge of the MI6 team guarding the World Economic Forum negotiations in Monte Carlo. 

It's not easy being M, particularly when the West is flat broke. Years of austerity have not worn well and the population of the Western Bloc is starting to get restive. Unless you gain access to an influx of cash, or something else that could pacify them, you are seriously worried that you could have a revolution on your hands. 

More immediately, you have two big issues on your agenda. The first is the outcome of this year's World Economic Forum, which could have vital consequences for the cash-strapped West. The conference has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremely risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now penniless, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West.  

The organiser of the conference is a wealthy and respected industrialist with business interests in both East and West called **Cherie LaFigure (Khadija)**. She was the one figure both sides could agree upon to preside over the conference and to invite official delegates from around the world. Conveniently, she also owns the largest and most stylish casino in Monaco, which will be the venue for the conference. Informal negotiations are continuing through the night, but a final vote of authorised delegates, who must present the official voting card supplied by Ms LaFigure, will be taken in full session at 10.45pm. Each delegate will have one vote, but will also be able to give a brief speech, which may include other means of persuasion... 

Your mission tonight is twofold: make sure that the West gets a good deal at the World Economic Forum; and prevent any disruption of the negotiations by Eastern Bloc operatives. You have one invitation for someone to attend the World Economic Forum to represent the West, but you haven't decided yet whether to go yourself or send someone else.

The other issue on your agenda is the status of the small island paradise of Tropico, which is as yet unaligned between East and West. You are aware that the Eastern Bloc is trying to persuade Tropico to join its side. This has really upset the CIA, who are desperate to avoid a Soviet enclave being created just off the coast of Florida.

You're not really sure why anyone would care about this small volcanic rock, which appears to produce nothing but rum, cigars and sunburn, but the Yanks got really worked up about it and threatened Britain with all sorts of dire consequences if they didn't help out.  A joint CIA-MI6 taskforce was created to try to persuade Tropico to join the West, and your designated CIA liaison officer **Felix Leiter (Steve)** was temporarily assigned to you to work on it. Unfortunately, a few months later, Felix Leiter was suspended from active duty by the CIA for some kind of diplomatic incident in Manila. You are aware that Leiter had a local contact on the island, but you're not sure how you would get in touch with them. You despatched your top agent, **James Bond (James G)** to investigate, but unfortunately, he hasn't yet reported back and you suspect he'll have gone AWOL with some native woman again. 

You are supposed to be supported in your missions by your team of MI6 agents: secret agent **James Bond 007 (James G)**; technical whizz kid **Q (Alistair)**; and your super efficient Secretary **Miss Eve Moneypenny (Sacha)**. At present, though, only Q is here in Monte Carlo, having travelled with you from London. You are aware that Bond is overdue to return from his mission in the Caribbean. You are also worried why Moneypenny has not yet arrived - she has never been late before. In fact, you are starting to get a bit concerned about morale and cohesiveness in your team. Bond has got an irritating tendency to go off piste and his flirtatious behaviour is starting to irk Moneypenny. She really needs to lighten up! Q has also been very quiet recently, and keeps muttering what sounds like some kind of lottery numbers. If only there were something you could do to bring your team together.

You were convinced you to go undercover this evening for security, so that no-one else will know who you really are. It's been a long time since you went into the field, and you're not entirely happy about this, but you chose one of your heroines as your alter ego, Max Zipp, F1 driver and local resident in Monaco for tax reasons. According to your research, Max gets on splendidly with the local aristocracy, including **Prince Dino of Monaco (Adam)** and they regularly go out yachting together.

Your Admiralty background means you're a dab hand at sailing yourself, and fancying a bit of a break, you decided to sail your old yacht, the Steadfast, round to the Med for the conference, rather than taking a flight. Unfortunately, when you ran into a touch of chop, (Q was muttering about the remnants of a hurricane) you realised your skills were a bit rusty, and slightly capsized. You thought you'd washed ashore in some quaint ruins, but eventually realised you and Q were trapped in an air-bubble in an ancient city. Some of the bas-reliefs were quite imaginative, and you took a rubbing, which you thought would go down well back at the club. Eventually, Q invented some thingummabobble, and got you safely to shore. His homing-rudder for the Steadfast had worked well, of course, and she'd piloted herself nicely back to the dock, upside-down.
