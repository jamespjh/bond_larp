James Bond
==========

Played by: James Goodman

Cover: Birdwatcher

Starting location: Tropico

Summary
-------
You are Bond. James Bond. 

You are currently finishing off a mission on the island paradise of Tropico. You are under *convincing* cover as a bird watcher.

*Special instructions: Pre-titles sequence*
------------------------------------------
As you may know, all Bond films begin with a pre-titles sequence, usually involving a chase or a fight. This evening's game will do the same. The pre-titles sequence will recap your latest mission in Tropico and provide a demonstration of the combat mechanic for the other players. The participants in the pre-titles sequence are You, your old adversary, Soviet agent **Ninelle (Michelle)**,  your local guide **Quarrel (Katherine)** and intrepid adventuring vulcanologist **Dr Caldera (Clare)**. 

The details of how you re-enact the mission are up to you and the other participants to decide before the start of the game, but the pre-titles sequence must include the following plot points (or you will break the game!!):

1. **James Bond** and **Ninelle** have teamed up to infiltrate the underground volcano lair/laboratory of local baddie **El Chupacabra (James H)** where you suspect he is up to no good.

2. When you arrive there, you find that he has taken prisoner **Dr Caldera**, who was exploring the volcano, known locally as the Eye of the Phoenix

3. A combat ensues (using the poker based combat mechanic). **El Chupacabra** will lose. **James Bond** must free the improsoned **Dr Caldera**. **Ninelle** gets away with some of **El Chupacabra's** lab notes, and **Quarrel**, revealing she is not Quarrel, but someone else in disguise, manages to steal away with some treasure from the laboratory.

Please fill James H in on what you want him to do as **El Chupacabra** before the start of the game!

Character
---------

You are James Bond, code name 007, multi-talented super-spy and MI6's top field agent. You are currently on a mission on the island paradise of Tropico, cunningly disguised as an innocent birdwatcher. 

You were sent to Tropico on a political mission. Tropico is as yet unaligned between East and West, but intelligence reports suggest that the Eastern Bloc is trying to persuade Tropico to join its side. This has really upset the CIA, who are desperate to avoid a Soviet enclave being created just off the coast of Florida. A joint CIA-MI6 taskforce was created to try to persuade Tropico to join the West, and your old friend **Felix Leiter (Steve)** was assigned as your designated CIA liaison officer. Unfortunately, Felix got into a spot of bother in Manila and was suspended from active duty for some kind of diplomatic incident. You are aware that he had a local contact on the island, but he hadn't disclosed their identity to MI6. Your boss, **M (Jan)** Head of MI6 and currently acting Head of the entire Western Bloc security apparatus, despatched you to investigate, and also to have a word with the local tinpot dictator **El Presidente (Jim)** about where his interests lie.

However, when you arrived on the island, it turned out that there were much more exciting things going on than mere politics. At the heart of Tropico Island is the volcano known as the Eye of the Phoenix. Though a constant threat to the lives of all islanders, its fertile soils are the source of the island's bountiful crops, and its volcanic muds and salts are a renowned product the world over, as foreigners try to capture a small part of the islanders' legendary beauty. A crazy scientist called **El Chupacabra (James H)** had taken up residence in the local volcano and turned it into some kind of underground laboratory. You ran across your old adversary **Ninelle (Michelle)**, a Soviet agent, who seems to have been sent here on a mission parallel to your own. You decided to team up to investigate the volcano lair, guided by trustworthy local bartender **Quarrel (Katherine)**. When you infiltrated **El Chupacabra's** lair, you discovered that he was holding captive a rather attractive young vulcanologist who had wandered in while exploring the Eye of the Phoenix, **Dr Caldera (Clare)**. You defeated **El Chupacabra** and freed **Dr Caldera** and are now looking forward to spending some quality time together in this romantic destination, as you're sure some appropriate gratitude will be in order. In fact, come to think of it, wasn't this where your own parents spent their honeymoon?

You have also heard that the World Beach Table Football Championship Finals are being held in Tropico this year. That might be worth staying on for, either to watch the skimpily-clad competitors or even to take part yourself. You realise, however, that you have not yet fulfilled the mission you were sent here to complete, and also that you will have to report back to M soon for a far less exciting mission in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

This year's World Economic Forum (WEF) has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremly risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now broke, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could therefore endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West.

Your were expected to meet M at the casino to join the MI6 team protecting the West's interests at the conference, along with your colleagues, technical whizz kid **Q (Alistair)** and that lovely young secretary of M's **Miss Eve Moneypenny (Sacha)**. You originally recruited Moneypenny when she was a simple chalet girl and you were deep undercover as a member of the Swiss bobsled team. She provided a welcome diversion on that occasion, and you know she still fancies you (how could anyone resist!) but you're keeping it at the level of flirtatious banter for the moment and trying to avoid an office romance.
