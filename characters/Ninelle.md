Ninelle
=====
Played by: Michelle

Cover: Croupier

Starting location: Monte Carlo, Monaco

Summary
-------------

You are Ninelle, the top Soviet field agent: assassin, spy, femme fatale. Tonight, you are on a mission vital to the security of Mother Russia. You are under cover as a glamorous croupier and casino hostess in Monte Carlo, where decadent capitalists have gathered for the World Economic Forum, which has moved from Davos this year. You are here to unmask the squalid deception of Western financial speculation for the frivolous gamble that it is.

*Special instructions: Pre-titles sequence*

As you may know, all Bond films begin with a pre-titles sequence, usually involving a chase or a fight. This evening's game will do the same. The pre-titles sequence will recap your last mission, which was on the island paradise of Tropico, and will also provide a demonstration of the combat mechanic for the other players. The participants in the pre-titles sequence are You, your old adversary, Western secret agent James Bond (James G), your local guide Quarrel (Katherine) and academic vulcanologist Dr Caldera (Clare).

The details of how you re-enact the mission are up to you and the other participants to decide before the start of the game, but the pre-titles sequence must include the following plot points (or you will break the game!!):

* **James Bond** and **Ninelle** have teamed up to infiltrate the underground volcano lair/laboratory of local baddie **El Chupacabra (James H)** where you suspect he is up to no good.

* When you arrive there, you find that he has taken prisoner **Dr Caldera**, who was exploring the volcano, known locally as the Eye of the Phoenix

* A combat ensues (using the poker based combat mechanic). **El Chupacabra** will lose. **James Bond** must free the imprisoned **Dr Caldera**. **Ninelle** gets away with some of **El Chupacabra's** lab notes, and **Quarrel**, revealing she is not really Quarrel, but someone else in disguise, manages to steal away with some treasure from the laboratory.

Please fill James H in on what you want him to do as **El Chupacabra** before the start of the game!

Character
-------------
You are Ninelle, top Soviet secret agent. 

Born to a down-and-out family in France, you were orphaned at an early age, and taken into the tender care of Mother Russia by a socialist co-operative working to raise awareness of the Marxian dialectic among the proletariat in Paris. This almost certainly saved you from a fate worse than death in the flea-pits and brothels of Pigalle, for which you are eternally grateful. Spotting your emerging physical and mental talents, they realized they had a gifted child on their hands, and you were quickly transferred to the People’s Advanced Ideology Centre in St Petersburg and later to the top secret State Security Training and Enhancement Facility, the Eastern Bloc's best spy school, run by **Dr Dita Hochsnell (Lorna)** in East Berlin. Dr Hochsnell’s regime was tough, but she is at the cutting edge of Soviet human advancement technologies, and helped you develop into the best field agent the Eastern Bloc has ever seen. You now work directly to the Head of Eastern Bloc Security, **General Anatol Alexis Gogol (Bob)**. You have an unwavering devotion to protecting furthering the interests of the Eastern Bloc against the decadent West.

Your last mission was on the island paradise of Tropico. It was a political mission of the highest delicacy and importance, vital to the future of the Eastern Bloc. Tropico is as yet unaligned between East and West, but intelligence reports suggest that the CIA is trying to persuade it to join the West. This obviously cannot be allowed. Gogol despatched you to make contact with the local Communist resistance, led by a local bartender and fisher called **Quarrel (Katherine)** and also to have a word with the current ruler **El Presidente (Jim)** about where his interests should lie.

You had heard that the World Beach Table Football Championship Finals are being held in Tropico this year. Realising that this would not only offer a useful cover story, but might also be a good opportunity to demonstrate the might of the USSR to the world, through your amazing sporting prowess, you took on the identity and (rather skimpy) clothing of a Beach Table Football player, supposedly on Tropico to train for the finals.

To your annoyance, on arrival in Tropico, you realized that your old adversary, Western field agent **James Bond (James G)** was also on the island, obviously on a mission parallel to your own. He told you that a crazy scientist called **El Chupacabra (James H)** who had taken up residence in the island’s volcano, known locally as the Eye of the Phoenix, and turned it into some kind of underground laboratory. He suggested you should team up to investigate the volcano lair, and you agreed on condition of taking along **Quarrel (Katherine)** supposedly as a local guide, but actually with the aim of the two of you overpowering Bond at some point during the expedition and finally getting rid of him for good. However, when you infiltrated El Chupacabra's lair, Quarrel seemed more interested in looting the place than helping you out, and Bond ran off with some flirty young creature who had been captured by **El Chupacabra** and was being held prisoner. You were left to defeat the supervillain on your own as usual. Typical.

You did manage to recover some of the research notes from the lair. Though they are mainly the insane rantings of a madman, they do mention that El Chupacabra was working on refining a newly-discovered element of great power, but also some danger, which he called 'Allurium'. He speculated that the presence of this element on Tropico is what accounts for the natives’ great beauty and the rumoured healing qualities of its volcanic mud, and mentioned that it has certain identifying properties, including being associated with a strange smell of coconuts and the colour gold. 

The information you recovered would probably be of interest to Gogol, but when you returned to the local village, an urgent communiqué from HQ was already waiting for you, directing you to travel immediately to Monte Carlo to support the Eastern Bloc's efforts to be victorious at the World Economic Forum, which will be coming to a conclusion tonight. 

This year's World Economic Forum has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremely risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now broke, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could therefore endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West.

You were tasked to infiltrate the conference, ensure success for the Eastern Bloc in the negotiations, and discover and disrupt MI6 plans to support the West. 

In order to get into the decadent West, you had to pretend to be a distressed migrant worker, victim of some dreadful people trafficker called **Cherie LaFigure (Khadija)**, who owns a big casino there and was looking for cheap labour. Her boat was, of course, overloaded, and you were washed overboard in a recent storm. You are an extremely skilled diver and swimmer, and took shelter in an air bubble in some rather weird underwater ruins. There was no time for a closer look, however, as you spotted an upside down boat drifting by, you clung on to it, and it carried you directly and smoothly into the dock in Monte Carlo, where you located LaFigure’s casino and showed up to work as a croupier and casino hostess.
