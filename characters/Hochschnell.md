You are Frau Professor Doktor Dita Hochschnell, pioneering psycho-physiologist, trainer and educator of *specialist* security personnel and coach of the Eastern Bloc Olympic team. Tonight, you have travelled from your home in East Berlin to the winter sports resort of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc, in order to attend an important scientific symposium, the First International Superhuman Soviet. The purpose of the conference is to share progress towards the development of the ideal comrade, a hero of progress and human development.

You are at the cutting edge of Soviet human advancement technologies and have been appointed Head of the top secret State Security Training and Enhancement Facility in East Berlin, the Eastern Bloc's best spy school, as well as coach of the Eastern Bloc's Olympic team. Through a combination of motivation hypnosis, intensive training regimes, pioneering surgery and top secret pharmaceuticals, you are able to push people higher, faster and stronger than they ever thought possible.

Tonight you are the keynote speaker at a conference in Skisky, a resort town high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc. Scientists are coming together for an important and secretive symposium, the First International Superhuman Soviet. Delegates to the symposium will have the opportunity to present their latest technologies as well as privately discussing their discoveries or superior capabilites with a senior member of the Politburo, **General Gogol (Bob)**. It is rumoured that those who convince him they have a valuable discovery or unique talent may earn the title, Hero of the Soviet Union. 

You think you have a pretty good shot at winning the title, given your excellent academic credentials, but you already have quite a large collection of medals and titles, and you're not sure that another one will make much difference. What you would really like is access to better resources to develop a real super-soldier without being subject to all these government funding constraints. Just think what you could do with the right facilities! Perhaps you can find an appropriate patron who really appreciates your talents and is willing to provide the resources you need. 

Still, you will be taking the opportunity to enjoy the world-class skiing and relaxation facilities at Skisky. Your host is the proprietor of the Skisky resort, **Misha Stroganov (Chris)** who always puts on a good party. You have not stayed at Skisky before, and you are looking forward to taking time to enjoy the local mountain culture, with its curious fauna and flora, and the folklore of the mysterious, mischevious mountain giants.

You also wonder whether you might run into your proteg√©e and former student **Ninelle (Michelle)** who you trained at the State Security Training and Enhancement Facility. She was easily top of her class and since graduation has been serving with distinction as the best field agent the Eastern Bloc has ever known. You're sure her success has something to do with that experimental surgery you performed on her on a very cold night in East Berlin. Whilst you normally warm yourself up with vodka, you'd run out that night and had to break open a very strange tasting bottle of rum a friend had brought back from a recent trip to Tropico. It tasted almost of coconut. You've never been able to reproduce that technique, despite trying it on quite a few students since. The body parts will no doubt come in useful for something else. Perhaps if you had another look at Ninelle, you could work out what it was.

Speaking of Tropico, if you tire of the cold weather, you have heard that the **World Beach Table Football Championship Finals** are being held on the island this year. This might be a good opportunity to do a bit of scouting for new talent, as well as demonstrating the superiority of Eastern training techniques to the world, and you should find out more about how to enter.

*and most importantly the application of* ***special secret ingredients***.
If you think you may have a potential secret ingredient, you should check with the GM.

When you think your invention is special enough, bring the form to the GM with your collaborators
and secret ingredients.
