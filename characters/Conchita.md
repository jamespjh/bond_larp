Dr Conchita Caldera
==========================================

Played by: Clare

Starting location: Tropico, island paradise.

Summary
-------
You are Dr Conchita Caldera, respected and intrepid adventuring vulcanologist. You are here on the island paradise of Tropico to investigate the strange seismic anomalies emanating from the local volcano, known as the Eye of the Phoenix.

PS: You may have worked out the game theme song based on the above. Please do not tell anyone and keep it as a surprise!

*Special instructions: Pre-titles sequence*
------------------------------------------
As you may know, all Bond films begin with a pre-titles sequence, usually involving a chase or a fight. This evening's game will do the same. The pre-titles sequence will recap your latest mission in Tropico and provide a demonstration of the combat mechanic for the other players. The participants in the pre-titles sequence are **James Bond (James G)**, Soviet agent **Ninelle (Michelle)**,  your local guide **Quarrel (Katherine)** and you. 

The details of how you re-enact the mission are up to you and the other participants to decide before the start of the game, but the pre-titles sequence must include the following plot points (or you will break the game!!):

1. **James Bond** and **Ninelle** have teamed up to infiltrate the underground volcano lair/laboratory of local baddie **El Chupacabra (James H)** where they suspect he is up to no good. They have hired plucky local **Quarrel (Katherine)** as a guide.

2. When they arrive there, they find that he has taken prisoner you, **Dr Caldera**, while you were exploring the volcano, known locally as the Eye of the Phoenix

3. A combat ensues (using the poker based combat mechanic). **El Chupacabra** will lose. **James Bond** must free the improsoned **Dr Caldera**. **Ninelle** gets away with some of **El Chupacabra's** lab notes, and **Quarrel**, revealing she is not Quarrel, but someone else in disguise, manages to steal away with some treasure from the laboratory.

Please fill James H in on what you want him to do as **El Chupacabra** before the start of the game!


Character
---------

You are Dr Conchita Caldera, adventuring vulcanologist. You're most interested in Volcanoes associated with interesting
legends of unusal phenomena - you've found that many of these are anchored in unusual geology, and you've got
several papers explaining UFOs as gas-propelled flying rocks, or lava-walkers being due to lava beneath transparent
insulating crystal.

Your latest investigation took you to the island paradise of Tropico, and to the volcano known as the Eye of the Phoenix. Reports of historical eruptions say that the volcano's lava is filled with gold, and that the volcano's
eruptive gases smell of coconut. You've confirmed these observations. After a day's caving, when you came back into town with some tiny fragments of golden, coconut-scented rock, you noticed everyone behaving strangely towards you, and realised that you'd become significantly prettier. You think this explains the historical success of the island's volcanic mud as a beauty product, and you've named this mysterious mineral "Allurium".  You've not yet explained another part of the legend, though, that after eruptions, the islanders sometimes become afflicted by a strange disease, known as the Dance of the Phoenix. Unable to stop moving, as many died due to fatigue as to lava.

The legends of the island say a sleeping God-Queen, Quetzalcoatl, lives at the heart of the volcano. Thinking this
would be the source of more of the remarkable material, you wanted to investigate further. You knew that an island
mining boss Juan Cuervo, known as El Chupacabra to the locals, had a mining operation inside the volcano, and broadcast his popular radio station
CU741 from the peak. Being intrepid, 
you snuck inside. You found a strange underground complex, with golden lava bubbling through pipes, built into ancient caverns, 
with carvings of firebirds and tentactled creatures, dinosaurs and ape-men. Unfortunately, you
were captured by El Chupacabra's henchpeople, and imprisoned there. The evil supervillain said you had little idea of
the true power of the volcano's golden blood - you get the impression Allurium can be used for much more than just
beauty products.

El Chupacabra barely kept you fed and watered, and you thought it was curtains, until you were rescued by a dashing secret agent named **James Bond - James G**. Gosh, what a dish! So resourceful, so tough. You're suprised by your reaction, you don't usually go for his type. Unfortunately, as James and his companions **Ninelle - Michelle** and **Quarrel - Katherine** were fighting El Chupacabra, they damaged the strange factory, and the volcano started to tremble -- you had to flee! You do hope James survived. Raawr.

You escaped back to your hotel, and slept very comfortably. Yet in the morning, you found yourself unable to keep still, dancing a little everywhere you went. Oh dear.


Objectives
----------

* Find a cure for the Dance of the Phoenix.
* Learn as much as you can about Allurium.
* Exploit your discoveries for fame and advancement -- look for somewhere to present your findings.

If you find items during the game which you believe may contain unrefined allurium, you should verify this with a GM.

You've been supplied with a patent form which you can use to
register an invention that could be of great power.

Be aware that the best inventions are likely to be created through **collaboration and teamwork**
*and most importantly the application of* **allurium**.

When you think your invention is special enough, bring the form to the GM with your collaborators
and secret ingredients.

Capabilities and assets
-----------------------
Add 1 card to combat checks for the following special abilities:

* Inventive +1: You're an advanced research scientist with an imaginative flair
* Intrepid +1: You're used to trekking through the wilderness, and are tough and a survivor

Immigration Status
------------------

You have a valid visa for the Western Bloc. You need to find a visa if you want to go to Skisky in the Eastern Bloc.

No-one needs a visa to get to the welcoming Island of Tropico.

Limitations
-----------

In the lair of El Chupacabra, you were exposed to Allurium dust, which has given you an
infectious disease called "The Dance of the Phoenix". You've read about this in discussions of past
eruptions of the Tropico volcano, when as many perished due to fatigue as due to the lava.

* Symptoms: Perpetual Motion Regime. You must always be moving. Dance a little, wave your arms, bob your head.
  You cannot be still.

People you know
---------------
James Bond (James G): He saved your life in the volcano.

Ninelle (Michelle): Seemed to be working with Bond during the fight with El Chupababra

Quarrel (Katherine): Local Tropican. You think she runs a bar somewhere

Dr Dita Hochsnell (Lorna): An academic you have previously met at conferences. She works at some kind of State research facility in the Eastern Bloc.
