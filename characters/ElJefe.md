Character
-------------

Known with a mixture of fear and respect (but mostly fear) as 'El Jefe' you are the resident industrialist, commercial baron and general legitimate businessperson on the island paradise of Tropico. You’ve been El Jefe for so long that no-one knows your real name, and sometimes even you forget it.

Tropico is a small island, but it has quite a few profitable resources, and you had them all sewn up via a convenient monopoly ‘deal’ with the previous Governor, in return for keeping quiet about his nighttime visits to the Llama farm. Your factories are the only source of the coveted small-batch Tropican rum, prized by connoisseurs worldwide. You also produce excellent Tropican cigars, and you’re venturing into the beauty industry with a line of volcanic mud products. At the heart of Tropico Island is the volcano known as the Eye of the Phoenix. Though a constant threat to the lives of all islanders, its fertile soils are the source of the island's bountiful crops, and its volcanic muds and salts are a renowned product the world over, as foreigners try to capture a small part of the islanders' legendary beauty. You’re currently planning your next product launch: a tropical themed coconut rum. You developed this by accident – unaccountably, sometimes your rum comes out tasting of coconut. At the moment, you haven’t worked out how to reproduce the phenomenon reliably, but you think it could be a smash hit internationally, perhaps mixed with pineapple juice, and you’re trying to think up a good brand name.

You also have a non-public line of business in what you like to call *labour mobility services*. It seems that quite a few young Tropicans are dissatisfied with life on the island. You can’t imagine why they would want to trade sun, sea and sand for servile jobs in the gloomy and polluted cities of Europe, but you have a ready supply of low-wage workers, and there are keen buyers out there with not-necessarily-totally-legal immigration routes. Your best customer is **Cherie LaFigure (Khadija)**, rumoured to be the richest person in the world, who needs a steady flow of cheap labour to keep up the healthy margins on her many business interests, in particular her vast casino network centred on Monte Carlo. 

You too would love to take your business interests to the next level by breaking into Europe, however there is one potential problem. Since Tropico gained its independence and **El Presidente (Jim)** was *[cough]* “elected” *[cough]* there have been rumours that the new Head of State is looking to affiliate the island with one of the superpowers, either the Eastern or Western Bloc. Tropico has never previously been aligned to either East or West, but you’ve heard rumours that a Communist cell has been established on the island, and you think that layabout bartender **Quarrel (Katherine)** may have something to do with it. It would be a business disaster if Tropico fell to the Soviet system – they’d probably nationalize your cigar business and force you to start producing vodka instead of rum!

So, when your personal information networks informed you that an American undercover agent **Felix Leiter (Steve)** had been sent to 
Tropico to counter the Eastern threat, you offered to put your totally legitimate services at the disposal of the CIA to help 
persuade El Presidente that joining the West with its free markets and light touch regulation, would be in the best interests of the 
population of the island as a whole. You had been working very effectively together to penetrate the dirty secrets of the current 
government, and come up with ‘persuasive’ material on which to build a case, but suddenly Leiter disappeared on an urgent mission 
and you haven’t seen him since.

You are hoping to hear from Leiter soon, but in the meantime, you’re pursuing your plans to ‘convince’ El Presidente of the merits of free market economies. You’re also keeping an eye out for any other business opportunities that might come your way. You know that one of El Presidente’s vanity projects is to organize the World Beach Table Football Championship Finals in Tropico this year. Competitors will be attending from around the world, and this might be a chance to make some useful contacts.

In addition, you have heard from Cherie LaFigure that this year's World Economic Forum has been moved from its usual location in Davos to one of her casinos in Monte Carlo. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremely risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now broke, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could therefore endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West, and this means that all the movers and shakers will be there, engaging in desperate last minute negotiations. You’d love to be involved in such a lucrative networking opportunity, if only there were some way you could get an invitation, and a visa to get out of Tropico.
