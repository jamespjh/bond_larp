Character
---------

You are Cherie LaFigure, the richest person in the world. You have business interests in both the Eastern and Western blocs, and you own the largest and glitziest casino in Monte Carlo.

This year's World Economic Forum has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo, and you are hosting the culminating high-level discussions in your casino tonight. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremly risky and unwise speculative investments. Monaco has borrowed extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund this activity, but is now broke, and even after extensive restructuring and austerity measures, it will only be able to pay back one side. 

The size of the debts is such that the outcome of the negotiations could therefore endanger the future of the entire economic system of either East or West. As a respected industrialist with business interests in both East and West, you were the one figure all sides could agree upon to preside over the conference and to invite official delegates from around the world. While Monte Carlo is currently in the Western Bloc, you don't really mind which side wins. The Eastern Bloc is just as welcoming a place for super-wealthy oligarchs to enrich themselves as the West, despite the occasional leftover talk of socialism.

Informal negotiations will continue through the night, but you will preside over the final vote of the World Economic Forum which must take place at 10.45pm. You have already sent an invite to the leaders of both East and West, but you also have 3 further delegate invitations. You also have the casting vote in the case of a tie.

**Mechanic: the final vote will take the form of a poker battle, with sides being granted extra cards based on appropriate contributions to the economic strength of their blocs.**

You're worried, however, that troublesome forces, unaligned to any government, will attempt to destabilise the conference. You can't have anything go wrong at this prestigious event. You also know that the intelligence forces of the East and West are probably running security efforts here tonight. If you can identify who they are, you might be able to manipulate them to your own profit.

You're also planning a special promotion this evening to pull in the gamblers. On a recent holiday to the island paradise of Tropico, you picked up a souvenir, a gold nugget you found whilst bathing in the volcanic hot springs that strangely resembles a gambling chip. You're planning to offer this **golden gambling chip** as a prize in your casino tonight to the most impressive and extravagant gambler. That should keep the money flowing!

Your casino is, of course, not your only source of wealth. Whilst East and West bicker, you have noticed that they are not the only game in town. The developing world, too, is a growing source of wealth and opportunity. You have extensive off-shore mining and drilling operations, and a fleet of cargo ships. You're committed to satisfying market demand wherever it arises, and have been happy to put your nautical assets at the disposal of those in need of informal labour mobility. In particular, during your recent holiday, you managed to hook up with a local small-time businessperson on the Island of Tropico, **El Jefe (Salley)** who seems to be able to supply a steady stream of cheap labour. You're always distressed when your philanthropic duties to help the struggling poor of the world make their way into the land of opportunity run you into trouble with the authorities, and you thought it might be difficult when a few of your latest batch washed overboard in a recent storm. Thankfully, you'd made them pay upfront. 

It was lucky that that pretty Tropican girl you've got working as a croupier, **Ninelle -- Michelle** made it back under her own steam. She's proving quite the asset in your casino, calming the tense visitors at the casino on this night. 

In fact, it might be worth another trip to the developing Island of Tropico or to Skisky in the Eastern Bloc to see if there are any other business opportunities you can take advantage of. Your vast wealth has left you able to appreciate the best that life has to offer, and you consider yourself
a conoisseur of the most refined tastes. You're always on the look out for experiences to excite your jaded palate.
You've heard good things of Tropican rum, and haven't had a chance to sample it yet. In addition, the President of Tropico, **El Presidente**, has even written to you asking to be admitted to the conference. You don't think the island has the cash to bail out Monaco, but perhaps you can get some benefit...

And yet, and yet... You're just not satisfied with being the richest person in the world. You want more.
Somehow you know that there are opportunities for increasing your wealth beyond even its current level.
