Quarrel
==========================================

Played by: Katherine

Starting location: Tropico, island paradise

Summary
-------
You are Quarrel, fisher, bartender and expert mixologist on the island paradise of Tropico. 

You are also the last in the line of high priestesses of Quetzalcoatl, the Phoenix-Goddess, said to be slumbering in the local volcano awaiting her time to rise again and defeat her evil brother Cthulhu.

This role involves acting as GM's assistant and revealing certain aspects of the plot at carefully chosen times during the game. There will be a full briefing with the GMs before we start. 

*Special instructions: Pre-titles sequence*
------------------------------------------
As you may know, all Bond films begin with a pre-titles sequence, usually involving a chase or a fight. This evening's game will do the same. The pre-titles sequence will recap a spying mission that happens in Tropico and provide a demonstration of the combat mechanic for the other players. The participants in the pre-titles sequence are You; two spies: Soviet agent **Ninelle (Michelle)** and  Western spy **James Bond (James G)**; as well as intrepid adventuring vulcanologist **Dr Caldera (Clare)**. 

**IMPORTANT SECRET: during the pre-titles sequence, you are not playing Quarrel, but somebody else in disguise as Quarrel: ERNST STAVRO BLOFELD. The other players will be under the impression that you are their local guide, helping them to infiltrate the lair of a local baddie. In fact, you will betray them at the last minute, and steal the secret treasure, revealing your true identity as you do so.** 

The details of how you re-enact the mission are up to you and the other participants to decide before the start of the game, but the pre-titles sequence must include the following plot points (or you will break the game!!):

1. **James Bond** and **Ninelle** have teamed up to infiltrate the underground volcano lair/laboratory of local baddie **El Chupacabra (James H)** where they suspect he is up to no good. They have hired **Quarrel** as their local guide.

2. When you arrive there, you find that **El Chupacabra** has taken prisoner **Dr Caldera**, who was exploring the volcano, known locally as the Eye of the Phoenix

3. A combat ensues (using the poker based combat mechanic). **El Chupacabra** will lose. **James Bond** must free the improsoned **Dr Caldera**. **Ninelle** gets away with some of **El Chupacabra's** lab notes, and **Quarrel**, revealing she is not Quarrel, but Ernst Stavro Blofeld in disguise, manages to steal away with some treasure from the laboratory.

Please fill James H in on what you want him to do as **El Chupacabra** before the start of the game!

Start of the game
-----------------

**Once the pre-titles sequence is over, you return to playing Quarrel. You have no recollection of the events that happened in the volcano, because you were not really there. You have a hangover.**

However, you are still acting as GMs' assistant in the first part of the game. 

You will discover that Tropico has been quarantined, due to an outbreak of a disease called 'The Dance of the Phoenix'. This means that nobody will be able to enter or leave the Tropico room, until the players there have discovered a cure.

**The cure is a bottle of coconut flavoured rum in your bar**

There should be enough clues in the players character sheets for them to work this out. However, if they are still stuck after 30 minutes, please start dropping hints (based on the background below) until they work it out. A GM will be based in your room during this time in case you need any help.

Once the quarantine is over, your duties as the GMs' assistant are discharged, and you can play the rest of the game however you like.

Character
---------

You are Quarrel, fisher, bartender and expert mixologist on the island paradise of Tropico. 

You run a bar on the beach which is the hub of island gossip, frequented by high and low alike, and the place to see and be seen. Perhaps because it's the only place...

Still, the quality of your excellent cocktails keeps the locals happy, and there's always the added excitement of a bottle of Tropican rum sometimes randomly tasting of coconut when you open it. All the rum on Tropico comes out of **El Jefe's (Salley's)** factories, along with all the cigars, and come to think of it all the goods that the Island produces. You happen to know that **El Jefe** has no idea why the cocounut flavour happens. If only she could market that, you're sure it would be a hit.

You also happen to know that these bottles of rum must be special, somehow blessed, since coconut is the symbol of Quetzalcoatl, the Phoenix-Goddess, said to be slumbering in the local volcano awaiting her time to rise again and defeat her evil brother the Kraken Cthulhu. At the heart of Tropico Island is the volcano known as the Eye of the Phoenix. Though a constant threat to the lives of all islanders, its fertile soils are the source of the island's bountiful crops, and its volcanic muds and salts are a renowned product the world over, as foreigners try to capture a small part of the islanders' legendary beauty. Before she died, your mother told you that you were the last in the line of high priestesses of Quetzalcoatl. You were not really sure what to make of that, but it's important to keep the local legends alive you suppose. At the very least, it entertains the tourists and keeps them drinking in your bar.

Sadly, **El Jefe** also has the volcanic mud business sewn up, and now locals are banned from bathing in the volcanic hot springs because she wants to sell tickets to rich tourists instead. In fact, you've heard that she's involved in a lot of unsavory dealings, and some of your friends have even said she can get them good jobs in Europe. They set off from Tropico excited and happy, but you never heard from them again. 

You're not at all happy about the direction in which Tropico is going, and you've tried to have a word with its recently elected ruler **El Presidente (Jim)** about giving more power to the people. You're not convinced he's listening though, and when a strange foreign woman **Ninelle (Michelle)** dropped into your bar one night saying she was a participant in the forthcoming World Beach Table Football Championships, which are to be held in Tropico this year, you engaged her in discussion about the economic difficulties of Tropico. To your surprise, she was very interested in your opinions, and even offered to support you in establishing a proletarian awareness-raising self-criticism circle in your village. You hope she has connections to the Eastern Bloc, and could bring put some pressure onto El Presidente to look after his own people before selling Tropico's soul to the highest bidder. Although all those Marxist theory lessons are starting to get a bit hard work...
