Prince Dino of Monaco
==========================================

Played by: Adam

Starting location: Monte Carlo, Monaco

Summary
-------
You are Prince Dino Grimaldi of Monaco. Monaco is apparently in a spot of bother at the moment, having borrowed extensively 
from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund some kind of stock market speculation that didn't go so well.
 This year's World Economic Forum has been moved from its usual location in Davos to Monte Carlo to discuss how exactly
 you'll be bailed out.

But petty economics doesn't really interest you. You are much happier when indulging your hobbies of fine wines, yachting and 
most of all paleontology. There are some really fascinating fossils in your principality and you dream one day of 
discovering a new species.

Character
---------

You are Prince Dino Grimaldi of Monaco. Monaco is apparently in a spot of bother at the moment, having borrowed
extensively from both the Eastern and Western blocs to fund some kind of stock market speculation that didn't go so well.
You knew you hadn't been doing too well in the casinos recently, but you lose track of all the zeroes sometimes. Whoops. Oh well. 

Still, plenty more fun to be had!

What with all this bailout business, there sure are some interesting types passing through your country this evening.
Sure to be some jolly japes. 

If the casino gets dull you can maybe find a few folks to go out to sea in a lovely yacht. You
used to have a lovely yacht of your own, but you're not a good sailer, and crashed it. 
You're a keen diver, and love exploring the ruins of the ancient cities off the coast of your lands.
Your father, before he passed, criticised your diving habit, speaking of the ancient terrors in the dark depths of the sea.
 "Beware the Kraken, My Son", he said, "he guards our ancient treasures, but has hated our family for thousands of years." 

Anyway, it was while diving off the coast of Monaco that you discovered a few fossils, which got you
*really* into paleontology; you love all the interesting names and bones. There's just something about Dinosaurs that really
speaks to you. Maybe it's that old family legend about the Grimaldis being secretly descended from an ancient God, 
grandad used to mutter his name, it was hard to hear, but
you think he said it was called Godzilla.

Perhaps a trip abroad would cheer you up, you have heard that the **World Beach Table Football Championship Finals** 
are being held in Tropico this year. This might be a good opportunity to demonstrate your sporting prowess. Tropico
sure has some amazing rums, perhaps you could sample a few.

Or perhaps a Ski trip. Apparently Skisky in the Eastern Bloc offers some thrilling skiing, and interesting stories about giant mountain primates,
probably extinct and unknown to science, called "Menki" by the locals.
But you'll need one of those dashed visas.
