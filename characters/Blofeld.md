Ernst Stavro Blofeld
==========================================

Played by: Chris

Starting location: Skisky, your glitzy winter sports resort high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc. 

Summary
-------
You are Mischa Stroganov, owner of a glitzy ski resort in the winter sports paradise of Skisky, high in the Alps of the Eastern Bloc. Tonight, your resort is hosting an important scientific symposium, the First International Superhuman Soviet. The purpose of the conference is to share progress towards the development of the ideal comrade, a hero of progress and human development.

Except you are really Ernst Stavro Blofeld, supervillain, and your ski resort is secretly your mountain lair. From here, you seek to grow your world-straddling criminal empire, SPECTRE.

Pre-Titles Sequence
-------------------

You are Ernst Stavro Blofeld, leader of SPECTRE, a worldwide criminal organisation.
Unfortunately, while you have great plans for SPECTRE, it is young as yet, and so far consists only of yourself and
your loyal henchman, (with anomalously huge hands), known as **PAWS - Alex**.

You've been on the lookout for further subordinates to join your soon-to-be-world-straddling criminal empire, and recently travelled to the island paradise of Tropico, to try to recruit El Chupacabra, a promising chap, who you heard on the grapevine had a rather nice volcano lair. Unfortunately, when you introduced yourself, he rebuffed you, foolishly claiming he could do better on his own. BIG MISTAKE.

Being a master of disguise, you joined up to help a couple of spies who it was obvious were there to bring down El Chupacabra. There was one there from each superpower, **James Bond -- James G** (with a cunning cover as a bird watcher) from the West and **Ninelle -- Michelle** (under cover as a beach table football player) from the East. Since you're a master of disguise, and it wouldn't do for the spy networks to be able to recognise you, you took the identity of a local fisherman and bartender **Quarrel -- Katherine** who they'd hired as their trusty guide. Together, the three of you broke into El Chupacabra's volcano lair. It was a very strange place, with a distinct coconut smell arising from the beautiful golden lava, which bubbled through the tubes and retorts of a twisted refinery. When you broke in to the inner sanctum, Bond and Ninelle fought with Chupacabra, eventually defeating him and freeing someone he was holding captive, but meanwhile you were able to open a vault containing his research notes and a strange golden rock. At this point, Bond and Ninelle were about to start fighting over the spoils, but you stole them and snuck away, revealing to them that you were not Quarrel after all, but ERNST STAVRO BLOFELD!! HAHA! HAHAHA!!

Cue titles.

Allurium
---------

The notes revealed that El Chupacabra had discovered in the volcano a mysterious substance he called **ALLURIUM**, which he claimed was capable of strange powers, making all who hold it more charismatic and impressive (explaining the legendary beauty of the islanders of Tropico), enhancing skills, and, he claimed, if appropriately deployed, capable of being refined into inventions and tools of great power. Sources of allurium, he found, could be identified by the
color **gold** and the smell or taste of **coconut**. Working with the material can be risky though; there is the possibility of catching a disease he called "the Dance of the Phoenix" from any Allurium dust.

When you first handled the material, you heard in your mind a faint whispering, an ancient power with whom you felt an immediate affinity. Inspiration surged in you, and your ambition for the future of SPECTRE soared. You quickly sketched a new logo for SPECTRE, which you are sure will help motivate the world's most ambitious leaders and greatest criminals to join your cause.

You feel sure you'll be able to use your allurium to further your goals, though to come up with a really earth-shattering invention you might need to recruit some collaborators with the appropriate skills to help build it. You also believe the voice can teach you more; it has suggestions for plots and schemes which you can fulfil, beyond the dreams of lesser supervillains. But it's hard to understand. You seek to find a way to contact the voice more clearly, but know that in this endeavour you will require first to build a great organisation to aid you.

If you find items during the game which you believe may contain unrefined allurium, you should verify this with a GM.

Character
---------

You returned to your base in the Eastern Bloc winter sports restort of Skisky to plot and scheme. This is the home town of **PAWS (Alex)**, whose real name is Major Ursus. He's a great fighter, a former Soviet commando, and is very loyal, but often bores you with local legends. You've made Skisky your base, and have quite a nice smuggling operation between East and West working across the nearby mountain border.

It's lonely at the top. No one else is really brilliant enough to understand the beauty of your criminal plans. You're really looking for co-conspirators for your dastardly empire. Or failing that captive spies. Anyone worth
explaining your plans to.

In the loneliness of power, you have found comfort in your menagerie; you have a large collection of powerful,
predatory, venomous, or otherwise dangerous beasts. You love your collection, and would like to add to it.

Skisky is a popular winter resort for holidaying Politburo members and you have made some useful contacts among them, including senior soviet General, **Gogol -- Bob**, who has been a frequent visitor to your facilities. You were delighted when he decided to base an important scientific conference here, the First International Superhuman Soviet. The purpose of the conference is to share progress towards the development of a an enhanced warrior or "supersoldier" - this could be useful to you. At the very least, you're sure there will be spies from both East and West present, and if you can turn any of them to your cause, it could be a source of useful criminal information. There are lots of vistors here for the conference, and you're keen to meet them.

There are other things going on at the moment, though, which draw your attention: in Monaco, tonight the
World Economic Forum is happening, moved from its usual location in Davos. The reason for the move is that the small principality of Monaco has somehow run up huge debts as a result of some extremely risky and unwise speculative investments. You're sure there are opportunities for extortion here.

Finally, you've heard that other supervillains are moving in to fill the vacuum left in Tropico by El Chupacabra, and you wonder if there are opportunities for recruits for Spectre there.

Objectives
----------

* Recruit supervillains or turn spies to expand SPECTRE
* Use your Allurium to spectacular supervillainly effect! Haha! Hahaha!
* Find a way to properly speak to the voice in your head.
* Find someone worthy to understand your dastardly plans.
* Grow your menagerie.

Special abilities
-----------------
Add 1 card to combat checks for the following special abilities:

Animals +1 : You have a menagerie 

Stealth +1 : You are a master of disguise

Base +1: You have a mountaintop lair

You have a lair, in which you can briefly (5 minutes) imprison people, and extract from them useful information.
You need to somehow successfully compel people into your lair to do this. (e.g. with violence or deception)
Ha! Hahaha! All Spectre members (excluding PAWS) gain this ability after you recruit them. You must
**explain your secret plan to them**, and then you may **require them to tell you a secret of theirs**.

Master of disguise: While you have imprisoned someone, you can pretend to be them.

**Mechanic:** explain to them what you want them to do, for up to 5 minutes. In that time, **that player is actually playing you and must do what you tell them**. You can only do this twice in the evening. When you want to do this, find a GM, who will explain the rule to your victim, and shadow the character to make sure they behave correctly. They will, of course, know what you asked them to do, **because you have explained it to them**!

Allurium: You start the game with some Allurium. This means you have **+1 card to all combat checks** while you possess the allurium, and are wearing a gold bandana. If you use your allurium to invent something, you will lose these benefits, but could gain something better. If you give away or put down the allurium, also give away or take off the bandana and lose the +1 bonus. Explain to the new bearer that they now have +1 to everything, should wear the bandana, and that they are inspired to invent things, and should talk to a GM if they want to know more.

Immigration Status
------------------

* You have a valid visa for yourself for the East.
* You have a fake visa yourself for the West.
* You have the ability, through your smuggling network, to create up to two illegal visas for each block.

No-one needs a visa to get to the welcoming Island of Tropico.

Limitations
-----------

You prefer to extend your criminal reach through minions, and aren't comfortable away from home. You have -1 card for any combat check outside Skisky (i.e. in Monaco or Tropico), except when in disguise.
