General Information 
===================
The theme of this year's game is James Bond. The game atmosphere is intended to be as in the movies, i.e fun, 
glamorous and cinematic. Kudos (and possibly other rewards) will be available for following Bond clich√©, 
rather than taking the spy aspects too seriously.

Rooms and travel
----------------

There are three locations in the game:

* Monte Carlo: casino city of the West
* Skisky, premier Eastern Bloc winter sports resort
* The island paradise of Tropico

These are far apart; you should take travel between them seriously. Instead of wandering freely,
you should roleplay the fact that a long plane flight is needed to reach Tropico, and that the iron curtain
stands between Monte Carlo and Skisky.

A central area represents the state of being in transit between these locations. Please **do not** talk to anyone you meet there. You may
continue to speak with someone who you left with and travel together with to the same place (you're talking on the plane). You don't need to waste your game time spending ages in the lobby, but do try to roleplay the fact that
moving locations isn't something you can do casually.

Visas
-----

The Iron Curtain stands between East and West and in order to enter Monte Carlo or Skisky you should have the appropriate visa or passport for the West and East respectively. Spot checks are common and if you do not hold the proper documentation, you will be deported back to your home country. 

No entry or exit restrictions are currently in place for Tropico, which has not so far aligned itself to either the Eastern or Western bloc.

An Alluring Gold Bandana
----------

In this game, some characters are particularly charismatic -- they're just really compelling, convincing, charming or sexy. This is represented by those characters wearing a gold bandana. So if you see someone wearing a gold bandana, you should roleplay the fact that they're very alluring. They're not actually wearing a bandana, it's just
a physical representation of their awesomeness. It's against the rules to take someone's bandana from them by force or to steal it (since it doesn't really exist...).

Communications
--------------

Movement between countries is not necessarily easy, as you will need to have the correct entry and/or exit visas, but if you wish to communicate with someone in another country you can always send an email. To send an email, write your message on one of the speech-bubble shaped post-it notes provided at the internet cafe in each country and stick it on the message board in the corridor where your recipient will be able to read it. 

Consider carefully what you put in your message. As everyone knows, internet communications are not private, so you never know who will be listening in: All players have access to the notice board at all times to view and post messages, but MAY NOT communicate in any way with people they meet there (since the notice board represents the internet and they are not physically present...).

**Messages can only be written at these designated internet cafe points using the post-its and pens provided. Any other types of messages will be removed by GMs.**

**Emails MAY NOT be removed from the noticeboard without GM permission.**

Combat and Challenges
---------------------

In any live game, it is inevitable that at times players will want to
interact in ways that cannot be handled through conversation and roleplay.

As always, it is illegal in this game to use physical means to
wrest objects from another person's grasp, fight, block another players'
way, and so on.

In keeping with the James Bond spirit, in this game, we use a poker mini-game 
to determine the winner in these circumstances.
Packs of cards have been placed throughout the play-space, find one of these and use it to
resolve the question.

In a basic battle, both players draw a card. The higher card wins. Aces are high.

If it is a tie, the *passive* action wins: the item remains with its current owner, 
the shot misses, or the blocked player continues on their way.

If either of you has a special ability that you can agree applies to the situation, this will allow you to
draw more cards. The number of extra cards will be written on your character sheet (or other in-game prop, if for example you have managed to find a really awesome weapon). 
When drawing more than one card, form the best poker hand you can from the cards you draw.
The best hand wins. Don't forget that in poker, ties are first broken by unmatched "kicker" cards.

The order of poker hands has been supplied in your character pack.

Here's an example of two-player combat:

* Player A: I would like to try to pickpocket your raygun from its holster.
* Player B: I don't want you to do that.
* A: But my character is a street urchin, and is really good at pickpocketing.
* B: But **my** character is a trained soldier, and knows to keep watch on his weapon at all times.
* A: OK, but my character is wearing noise-cancelling shoes, made by the world's most high-tech shoe company
* B: OK, so that sounds like +2 to you and +1 to me
* A: Sure. But I'm the one trying the action, so if it's a tie, you win.
* B: Yep, that's right.
* A: I'll get the cards... I drew a 3, a Jack, and a Queen.
* B: OK... I got two sevens. My pair beats your Queen High. I keep my Raygun.

If more than one player teams up together, they share just one hand, but gain a card per
team member, and special abilities from all team members apply.

If a battle occurs with more than two sides, the best hand from all sides wins.

Sometimes, you may be asked to compete against the game, rather than each other.
In this case, the poker hand you need to beat will be shown to you.
It will be hard to win these alone, so team up.
You should give yourself extra cards, based on your applicable special abilities.
Don't cheat. Ask a GM if you feel unsure.
There will usually be a time-delay on retries for these, e.g. every ten minutes, 
so if you fail, you can come back after the time
indicated and try again.

For example, something in the game might read:

A gang of evil henchpeople block your way, armed with flamethrowers. You need a hand better than
JJ 77 4 to beat them.
You and a friend are fighting them. Your friend is a kick-ass ninja, which is worth +1 card.
You are wearing a flame-proof suit. That is worth +1 card too, so between you you have 4 cards.
You draw 8883. Three of a kind beats two pair, so you defeat the evil henchpeople.
