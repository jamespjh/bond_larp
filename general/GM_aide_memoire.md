1955: Game start. Walkaround and show players rooms, cards, comms board, bandana. Answer questions.

2005: Start of pre-title sequence

2010: End of pre-title sequence. Titles. People go to their start rooms. Start of game proper. Tropico quarantined.

GM in Tropico: DON'T FORGET TO INFECT PEOPLE (EXCEPT BOND) WITH DANCE OF THE PHOENIX, gradually depending on proximity.

2030: Ninelle becomes symptomatic

GM in Monaco: DON'T FORGET TO INFECT PEOPLE

2040: Earliest Tropico can reopen. If disease-free sooner, waiting for tests.

2055: Latest Tropico can reopen. Quarrel to hint if players stuck.


2110: Players should be making good progress in Yeti/Atlantis by now.

IF PLAYERS ARE STUCK ON QUESTS, SEED COMMS ABOUT 741 AND MENKI AND OLD GODS

Don't forget if Steve finds allurium it reminds him of the stuff in Manila.

WHOEVER GETS INTO VOLCANO GETS DANCE OF THE PHOENIX

Players who have allurium by now should be submitting inventions. GMs seed whispers from the old gods to
players who get allurium, and stronger hints to people who build inventions. Inventers
should be signalled that their inventions will be more powerful in a certain place, they should find, and that
they can be supercharged with allurium.

2115: There should be some Beach Table Football prep? If not, nudge El Presidente.
2130: Beach Table Football finals.

2145: Eye of the Phoenix Erupts. Tropico sealed. Allurium distributed

GIVE OUT 10 minus ALREADY FOUND ALLURIUMS
REINFECT WITH DANCE OF PHOENIX

2200: Ash cloud dissipates. Tropico reopened. Disease can spread.

 - Aim to have signed off at least 3 inventions by 2230.
 - HSU should be awarded in this period if not already.
 
If inner sanctums not yet found, seed further hints.
If inventions triggered in inner sanctums, inventors are told they are waiting for these to charge up.
Spare invention forms given out to people with allurium.

2245: WEF Vote. Iron Curtain falls!

2250: Any players with old god contacts, who have inventions charging up, these go off. If this hasn't
happened yet, appropriate inventors or avatars with allurium receive very strong whispers and 
are summoned to either Atlantis or Volcano (depending if they are goodies or baddies)

2300: Final battle. Chthulu vs the Phoenix! Game Over!
