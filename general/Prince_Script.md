Unfortunately, you are unable to be present in person at the conference deciding the whole future of your 
country, because you are off doing something more interesting instead. 
However, you have left a video message to persuade the assembled notables of the importance of your cause.

The message **must** contain the following facts:

1. You caused the debt crisis due to your gambling habits
2. The Grimaldis are a long and illustrious line.
3. One of the legends of the Grimaldis is that they are descended from undersea dinosaur kings, 
hence your interest in paleontology 
4. At some point, mention the word **'Godzilla'**.
