Background document for all characters
======================================

Initial email
-------------
The theme of this year's game is James Bond. It therefore takes place in three glamorous international locations. While each
character starts in one of these locations, for costume purposes, you may wish to have options available to suit all the
settings. The three locations are:

* A sophisticated casino in Monte Carlo, Monaco (evening wear)
* Skisky, a glitzy Eastern Bloc ski resort (ski/apres-ski wear)
* The island paradise of Tropico (beach wear)

If you have any questions please ask. It would be great if you could acknowledge receipt of this email.

Sue and James
