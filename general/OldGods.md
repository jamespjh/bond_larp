The Old Gods
============

In long-ago times, before the ice came and went, before the seas rose and fell, the world was inhabited by
ancient people, who walked among the stars, did not age or die, and who could live and prosper in every corner of the earth.

Their four tribes lived together harmoniously, peacefully gardening their own habitats for the good of the world:

* The largest tribe, the earthfolk, lived on the great plains, taming giant lizards, using them to move and travel
  the earth at will.
* The skyfolk lived among the mountain peaks, climbing with great strength along the vertical cliffs,
  their white fur giving them warmth in the cold high air.
* The beautiful sunfolk lived in the steaming forests, building their cities atop flaming
  mountains, bathing in the boiling waters and striding across melting rocks.
* The deep ones lived in the ocean, breathing the dark waters, singing ancient songs,
  and communing with the strange creatues of the deep.

Each tribe loved and worshipped its god-king, whose powers far surpassed the rest of their people:

* Godzilla, the thunder-lizard, king of the earthfolk
* Quetzalcoatl, the phoenix queen, fire-winged dragon ruler of the sunfolk
* Kong, the Yeti King of the Skyfolk
* Chthulhu, the Kraken, old god of the deep ones

Yet the gods could not live in harmony forever. Chthulu grew apart from his siblings,
singing his own strange songs. Desiring dominion over the world, he raised a great tide to
inundate the lands of the Earthfolk, whose culture was centred on a vast basin, protected from the ocean
by a great wall. When the waters broke across the Middle Sea, Godzilla and most of his people were drowned.
A few survived, and lived a squalid life in caves and huts, the ancestors of humanity as we know it.

Seeing this destruction, Quetzalcoatl withdrew upon herself, hiding her people in the jungles, safe, as she thought,
from Chthulu's power, sleeping alone in the flaming heart of her favourite island. 

She no longer shared her warmth with the world. Without the warmth of the flames beneath the
earth, which had been traded through tunnels to warm their frosty homes, the ice came to the peaks, and the
skyfolk dwindled and were forgotten. Even King Kong eventually froze to death, his warm heart lost among the mountains.
Ice spread across the land.

Now alone in an icy world, Chthulu and his people withdrew into the deepest dark, content that their power was unchallenged.

Millenia later, humanity rose again. Juan Cuervo, a miner on the island of Tropico, found a mysterious mineral in the rocks
of the volcano known as the Eye of The Phoenix. Though he did not know it, this is the fossilized body of the hibernating
Quetzalcoatl, her essence now spread among the bones of the mountain. He began experimenting with this mineral, investigating
its amazing properties, discovering once again the technologies of the ancients. Yet his communication experiments disturbed
the Kraken, Chthulu hearing broadcasts on frequencies unused for millenia. He whispered to Cuervo, who grew cruel and cold,
referred to amongst the people of the island as El Chupacabra.

The Mechanic
------------

Characters, when they first receive allurium,
will have a sense of the rock almost whispering to them,
inspiring them with ideas of the uses to which it can be put.
For some, this might be suggestive enough that they may
want to try to invent a way of contacting the rock more clearly.

If anyone builds an invention which the GM might consider could be used to 
contact or raise an Old God, they should indicate, when the device is completed,
through some hint, that in the right place it can be used to 
access greater power. 

For example, for a communication device:

> When you activate your device, you overhear a conversation between two unknown parties.
You feel a sense of power and confidence in their manner of speaking, 
one angry and passionate, one cold and cruel.
The two far-off voices debating, speaking by turns with different
background sounds, as if talking over a one-way radio channel.
You can't make out the details but in the background of one voice
is the sound of the sea, in the other, the crackling of fire. 
You will need to bring the device closer to the voices' location to really hear what is going on.

If in Tropico, the angry voice might be louder, if in Monte Carlo,
the cold voice.

For example for communication device, a voice will say: 

> I am Quetzalcoatl, the Phoenix Queen. The world you know is
under a dire threat, from my Brother, Dread Chthulu. Bring to me
my chosen vessel, one who understands my fire, and as much of my lost
blood as you can gather, to this mountain where I sleep. Then
I will awaken, to defend this world from my brother's darkness.
Great Glory and Honor will come to the Hero who thus saves
the world."

(Conchita might hear "...device, O my chosen vessel... ". Blofeld
will hear "Begone, disciple of my dark brother!")

(Depending on how things go, the GM may allow another
player who shows affinity with the Phoenix 
to become the vessel, rather than Conchita.)

If they activate it in Skisky, they will hear a deep silence,
and be filled with a sense of sorrow and of cold. If the 
bones of Bigfoot have not yet been found, they will be given
directions to him, bypassing that quest. They will hear two
far off voices, one weeping, one cackling in glee.

If they activate it in the ruins of Atlantis, off Monte Carlo, 
they will hear the crashing
of the sea, and a voice saying 

> O great one, I can deliver
unto you mighty power and bright glory. Bring as much of my
lost blood as you can gather, and my chosen vessel,
he who controls the world's secrets, to the ruins' of my enemies
city beneath the waves, so that I may bless him with
my grace.

(Depending on how things go, the GM may want to allow M or
Gogol to become Chthulu.)

Once the endgame is reached, the character with an appropriate invention
will connect to the old god. Give them the
soft-toy, and explain that their awareness has now combined with
the God.

Blofeld:

> You are filled with pain, and knowledge, and a profound sense
of self worth, glory, and your uniqueness as the most important
man ever to walk the earth. The power and knowledge of the Old
God, Chthulu, threatened to overcome your personality for a
moment, but your own great Ego could not be destroyed. Instead,
you and the Kraken are now one, mightier than either,
your hatreds joined with his, nursed for ten thousand years.
You are more than Blofeld, more than Chthulu, you are Blothulu,
ruler of all!

E.g. Conchita:

> The knowledge of the volcano is yours at last, 
changing you into who you were always meant to be. All
the confusion, all the self doubt, are gone. You are Conchita still,
but you are Transformed, glorious in your new shape, the
Dragon of the tropical skies, Quetzalcoatl, the Phoenix Queen!

The final battle
----------------

If only Chthulu has risen, he can threaten the world with his power.
Those not under his thrall, (those who did not join Spectre),
must unite to build an Allurium weapon to defeat him. If need be, the GM
might inform a scientist among the others that they must take
the best Allurium weapon they have managed to make, supercharge
it with as much Allurium as they can find, and direct it at
Chthulu.

If only Quetzalcoatl has risen, depending on her motivations,
she might protect Tropico
from any threats, leaving it independent. The GM
could inform a scientist in the foreign power
which won the WEF that seismic data appears to show that
Tropico has successfully built a Superbomb. They 
might want to try to stop Tropico rising as a mighty world power,
and a similar showdown will ensue.

Similar scenarios should be constructed on the fly, depending on the post-
rising personalities of the old gods, such as to set up some kind of
human-vs-god confrontation.

If *both* old gods arise, then they will do battle.
Others can join in with their superweapons.

In the end, the sides do Poker battle. Each minion adds a card. Inventions, Bond, or
really anything that can be reasonably claimed to be to do with allurium can 
add one or more cards.

This will be a rediculous poker hand, with the best five cards probably
of fifteen or so winning!
